# Lab-Inventory-system

This project utilizes the Splay Tree data structure and graph to keep track of chemicals and suggest possible combinations by checking compatibility.The Lab Inventory System is designed to help laboratories manage their chemical inventory efficiently. It keeps track of various chemicals and their properties using a Splay Tree data structure for efficient searching and retrieval. Additionally, it utilizes a graph's algorithms to check the compatibility of different chemicals and suggest possible combinations.

The project uses command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Lab Inventory System. Users can perform operations such as adding chemicals, removing chemicals and viewing compatible chemical combinations.
