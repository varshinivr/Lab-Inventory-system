# Lab-Inventory-system

This project utilizes Splay Tree data structure and graph to keep track of chemicals and suggest possible combinations by checking compatibility.The Lab Inventory System is designed to help laboratories manage their chemical inventory efficiently. It keeps track of various chemicals and their properties using a graph data structure and uses splay tree efficient searching and retrieval. Additionally, it utilizes a graph's algorithms to check the compatibility of different chemicals.

The project uses command-line interface (CLI) for interacting with the Lab Inventory System. Users can perform operations such as adding chemicals, removing chemicals and viewing compatible chemical combinations.
